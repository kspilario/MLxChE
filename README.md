# MLxChE: Intro to Machine Learning for Chemical Engineers

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my courses: ChE 197 and ChE 297, Intro to ML for Chemical Engineers. This repository contains Python codes (Jupyter notebooks) and datasets used in class. ChE 197 is an elective course for undergraduates and ChE 297 is for graduate students at the College of Engineering, University of the Philippines, Diliman. These courses aim to introduce the field of machine learning (ML) to chemical engineers, including the mathematical details, code implementations, and chemical engineering applications of basic supervised and unsupervised ML methods.

## Usage
The repository is organized into folders based on the weekly topics covered in the class, as follows (under construction):
- [Linear and Logistic Regression](/Week_1)


## Contributing
If you find any issues or have any suggestions for improvement, feel free to contact me via kspilario@up.edu.ph. If any codes are not working on your terminal, let me know. :)
